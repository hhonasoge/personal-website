Repository for my personal website. Website can be found here: https://ancient-plains-64726.herokuapp.com/

This is the code for the personal blog website of Harsha Honasoge. The frontend uses React, communicating with a backend API via HTTP/JSON. Backend API uses express as a web framework, MongoDB for database, Passport for user auth (currently only supports single user, but the goal is to build this into a multi-user blog platform), and Tailwind CSS for styling.
